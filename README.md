# Client Tracker

This application will track Clientele, as well as particular client-information as needed.  It should act as a ticketing tool, a (lite) project tracker, and client manager.

## Portfolio

This is primarily used as a portfolio project, though I hope my many iterations over it will one day lead to a production-ready application.

In the meantime, feel free to explore.  `npm install` and `npm start`
